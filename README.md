# Got SKILLZ? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jamin4jc/skillz.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jamin4jc/skillz)

I have always had a difficult time tracking all of the tangents in my head.

The purpose of this project is to provide an interface to track the many musings in my mind.

## Goals

1. Establish a model that makes sense in bits as well as my head
2. Register various resource links that relate to these things.
3. Organize / Prioritize research and allow for an inbox-based model that can be sorted later (stream of consciousness)

There will probably be more goals, but this is good to start

## Things to explore:

* Data modeling: standard RDBMS model / nosql document model / graph data model / hybrid
* mobile UI / easy-browser integration
